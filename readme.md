The Beti text formatting engine will produce HTML documents from a source file
using little more than indented paragraphs and a small set of keywords. The goal
is to produce HTML documents from simple comments without a lot of extra markup
symbols leaving the original comments as uncluttered and readable as possible.
The feature set is intentionally sparse to maintain simplicity. Formatting
features such as headings, text blocks, spans, tables and lists are easily
achieved using a few keywords.
