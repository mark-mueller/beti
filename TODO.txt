    -----------------------------------------------------------


To Do:

        Page anchors are not working.  Heading number being prepended to href.





Wish List:

    Make a :footer directive.

    Want to add ./file as link to a file.

    Make adding directives easier.

    Parsing instructions:
    *  Parse all comments until we hit the first "package", "var" or "func" keyword.
    *  If package found, name will become page heading.
    *  After package, only comments immediately preceding "var" or "func" will be parsed.

    Add a Mode variable.
    *  The ":beti" keyword will enable parsing even if no comments or keywords are found.
    *  Block commnts or line comments will be treated the same.
    *  White space between line comments will have no affect.


    Wrap entire h1 sections in a div so they can be closed.
    Add style directive.

    Add package name header
    Add public var section
    Add import section

    Generate an interim format in JSON.
    {
         "s":"h1",
         "h":"Section heading",
         "c":"Section content"
    }

    Change func directive or add a new one so it will work with "function" also.

    Look for package name. If found, make it the heading.

    Look for NAME, VERSION, AUTHOR, COPYRIGHT constants

    Look for "var" keywords precedded by a comment.
    Do not bother with muliple var declarations.

    , supply -type flag to instruct beti what type
    of data we have.  (beti, go).  If no flag, assume beti.

    If the file is .beti or .txt, parse all lines, ignoring comments.
    Otherwise, only comments will be parsed.

    Like GoDoc, only parse the comments immediately preceding a public func,
    or public var.

    Since the type of input cannot be determined using stdin, then :beti or -someflag
    will be required for plain text data. Else, parsing will begin at block comments.
